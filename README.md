## 👥 Group Project

**Team**: [CSAADZIDI](https://github.com/CSAADZIDI) & [aruide](https://github.com/aruide)

### 🔬 Project: Wa-Tor

> The goal is to emulate an ecosystem of sharks and fishes, where sharks eat the fishes if they are next to them, and fishes avoid them if they can. Each species will reproduce if they live long enough. Everything will be output in a Python interface.

### 🌟 GOALS

* Create the algorithms that dictate the fishes/sharks behavior
* Create an interface for the user to interact with
* Manage persistence (simulations history)
* Work together through Git

### ✅ What We Ended Up With

* Fully functional simulation
* Interface with:

  * Simulation output
  * Simulation parameter inputs
  * Resizable grid
  * Real-time counters
  * History
  * Pause/resume/cycle through previous turns
* Fully operational persistence through PostgreSQL in 3 tables:

  * One for the simulation parameters and output
  * One for the state of each turn of the simulation
  * One for every entity that existed inside that simulation
* A PowerBI Desktop model using that database to show multiple metrics, globally and/or related to one simulation/parameter
